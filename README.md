CLUSTER DEComposition suite
---------------------------

This repository contains software for re-expressing configuration
interaction (CI) wave functions as coupled cluster (CC)
expansions. The software is composed of two parts

1) a program that generates the necessary recursion relations and
stores the instructions on disk

2) a program that reads in a CI wave function and translates it into a
CC expansion.

If you use this program, please cite the following reference:

S. Lehtola, N. M. Tubman, M. Head-Gordon, and K. B. Whaley, "Cluster
decomposition of full configuration interaction wave functions: a tool
for chemical interpretation of systems with strong correlation", to be
submitted.

For further information on the program, read the above reference.

To compile the code, run make.
